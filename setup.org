This document is here to remind myself that:
1. I'm not stupid
2. The fact that I don't remember how to set something up I last touched 3 years ago is alright
3. It took me 3 hours to figure it all out
4. CLion is shit
5. How to actually make it all work

The goal is to setup "handmade hero", a project by C. Muratori (https://handmadehero.org/) to:
1. Follow his logic precisely, so developing for Windows
2. But from the comfort of my Linux setup

What we need:
1. wine (yay -Syu wine)
2. mingw64 on host (yay -Syu mingw-w64)
3. mingw64 in wine prefix (I used https://github.com/Vuniverse0/mingwInstaller/releases/download/1.2.1/mingwInstaller.exe)
4. gdb and friends.

Building:

x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -ggdb -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -D HANDMADE_SLOW=1 -D HANDMADE_INTERNAL=1 -I /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/ ../src/handmade_win32.cpp -lgdi32 -o handmade_win32.exe

notable things:
x64 architecture compiler; static linking; x64 mingw includes.

Installing mingw64:
wine mingwInstaller.exe; choose x64, msvcrt, and the version that's the same as mingw-w64-headers: 11.0.0-1 (this might be not actually needed but still)

Wine subst drives:
ln -s ~/git_tree/handmade-hero ~/.wine/dosdevices/w:

Then, we're starting a gdbserver from wine's bin, and connecting to it with our vanilla gdb:
/usr/bin/wine gdbserver.exe localhost:12345 W:\\build\\handmade_win32.exe

And connecting to it with dap-mode with this config:
(dap-register-debug-template
  "localhost:12345"
  (list :type "cppdbg"
        :request "launch"
        :name "cpptools::Run Configuration"
        :MIMode "gdb"
        :MIDebuggerServerAddress "localhost:12345"
        :program "${workspaceFolder}/build/handmade_win32.exe"
        :cwd "${workspaceFolder}"))

DONE!
